# Bank Term Deposit Subscription Classifier
# Problem Setting:
<br/>Banks are financial institution that are licensed to grant loans and to receive deposits from its customers. For a bank to function, it must make profits so as to pay its employees as well as sustain against its competitors and the best way for it to do so is through term deposits. Term deposits are fixed term investments where someone (person or entity) deposits an amount to the bank for a certain amount of time and the bank pays back the money with some interest. This allows the bank to know for certain how much money does it have that it can lend to others at any point in the future. The bank uses this money to invest it into other projects that pay them a higher rate of return than the term deposit’s interest rate thus making a profit in between. These projects could be lending money to others at a higher interest rate for the borrower or investing it elsewhere. Term deposits are extremely safe and are therefore appeal to low-risk investors who want to ensure security in their earnings.

# Problem Definition: 
<br/>The data is sourced from a Portuguese banking institution. This institution reached out to its clients (mostly through direct phone calls) to enquire if they’d be interested in making a Term Deposit with them and the results have been documented. It contains some information about their clients and when were they contacted regarding this campaign and if they ended up making a Term Deposit or no. The basis of our project is to build a classification model that could use the details of their clients and this previous marketing campaign results to predict if the client makes a Term Deposit or no. The model could then be used to seek out potentially clients who would make the same investment.
